[Data Structures]
- Abstract data type(adt): defines operations but not their implementation
    - logical view
    - operations
    - cost of operations
    - implementation


[Linked List]
- The data is stored into nodes, each node have a value and a next field, the next field is a pointer to the next node
in the list.
- By convention the first node of the list is called "head", and the last is called "tail"

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next


[Arrays and Memory]
When incrementing arrays size, under the hood another array is created with almost the double
size and the old one is deleted, allocating the new array in the memory.

1 integer = 4 bytes


[Big O Notation and Time Complexity]
Time complexity: how the runtime increases as the length increases too.
By convention BigO notation is used without any coefficient, for example, O(2n^2) is equal to O(n^2)
O(1) - constant time
O(n) - linear time
O(n2) - quadratic time
